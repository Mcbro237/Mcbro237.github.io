            <h3>What You Need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, chopped</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>¾ pound ground lamb</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: In a medium bowl, mix flour, salt and butter until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Pour in water, using more (up to approximately 1/4 cup) if necessary to make a smooth dough. Pat into a ball. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead 10 minutes, or until dough is smooth and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover and set aside.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Heat oil in a large, deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Step 3: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Stir in onion, garlic, green chile peppers and ginger. Cook 5 minutes, or until onions are golden brown. Stir in turmeric, chili powder, ground lamb and salt. Cook until the lamb meat is evenly brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in garam masala and lemon juice. Continue cooking 5 minutes, then remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Divide dough into 15 equal portions. Roll portions into balls, then flatten into 4 inch circles. Cut each circle in half. Dampen edges and form semicircles into cones. Fill cones with equal portions of the lamb meat mixture. Dampen top and bottom edges of cones, and pinch to seal. </li>
                
     <li>Step 5: Carefully lower cones into preheated oil a few at a time. Fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm. </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
                <li>Step 1: Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>

            <p>This is a traditional sweet, sweet ball that bursts in your mouth!
            <h3>What You Need</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dry milk powder</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted</li>
                  <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>3½ cup warm milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped almonds (Optional)</li>
                 <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
                <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
                  <li>7 fluid ounces water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon rose water</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: In a large bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking powder, and cardamom. Stir in the almonds, pistachios and golden raisins. Mix in the melted ghee, then pour in the milk, and continue to mix until well blended. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 2: In a large skillet, stir together the sugar, water, rose water and a pinch of cardamom. Bring to a boil, and simmer for just a minute. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Step 3: Fill a large heavy skillet halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for at least 5 minutes. Knead the dough, and form into about 20 small balls. Reduce the heat of the oil to low, and fry the balls in one or two batches. After about 5 minutes, they will start to float, and expand to twice their original size, but the color will not change much. After the jamun float, increase the heat to medium, and turn them frequently until light golden. Remove from the oil to paper towels using a slotted spoon, and allow to cool. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool slightly.
                <li>Step 4:Place the balls into the skillet with the syrup. Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, squeezing them gently to soak up the syrup. Serve immediately, or chill.li>
